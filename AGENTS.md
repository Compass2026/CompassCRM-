# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Compass Client Platform

Internal Compass Marketing Advisors agency tool — every client, their department
pipelines (SEO / Website / Social / CRM / Paid Ads), and the recurring monthly
Reporting cycle. Full build spec: `docs/spec.md`.

- **Stack:** Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (Base UI — triggers
  use `render`, not `asChild`), Supabase (project `compass-client-platform`,
  ref `iokcopiyzajigvhwexhe`).
- **Schema:** `supabase/migrations/` mirrors what is applied to the remote
  project via the Supabase MCP. Enrollment / convergence / monthly-cycle
  automations live in Postgres triggers and functions — see
  `0001_initial_schema.sql`.
- **Auth:** internal team only (Supabase magic link). RLS is enabled everywhere
  with a blanket authenticated policy; the Phase 5 client portal only adds
  client-scoped policies.
- **Phases:** 1 Foundation (done) · 2 Trackers (keywords/rank/GSC/content/social/
  reports) · 3 Billing (Stripe, port from Show Me CRM) · 4 Views & publishing ·
  5 Client portal.
